## Running the project

If you run the project on Android Emulator and says that `Google play services are not supported in your device`. the quicker way to solve this problem is execute the in your android device scanning the QR code with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client).

if you have problems working with the [Bare workflow](https://youtu.be/i8bni7mUqXE?t=177). you could select **Manage flow**. the blank Javascript or typescript reduce complexity in some cases.

## Known issues

Expo SDK and libreries are always updating their versions and deprecating others. before installing the libreries run.

```
    yarn add expo@latest
```

Next you can run:

```
    npx expo install --fix
```

Expo will show you what dependencies need to be updated. Install the dependencies expo suggest you. It is possible that there is cache and you have to run.

```
    yarn start --reset-cache
```
